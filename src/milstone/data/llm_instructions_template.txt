Milstone CLI – LLM Usage Notes
================================

This file is generated automatically inside each project's `.milstone/` directory so language models
understand how to operate the tool safely. Use `milstone --help` or `milstone <command> --help` to see the full option set.
Never edit files under `.milstone/` or `{status_md}` directly—always use Milstone commands.

Milestones (High-Level)
-----------------------
* Create milestones with clear titles, descriptions, owners, and expected hours.
* Milestone descriptions must state what has to be done so they can serve as acceptance/done criteria later.
* Keep milestones small and actionable; split large work into smaller milestones.
* Update status, priority, and parent relationships as work evolves.
* Log progress regularly with short, specific summaries; include what was done and, if available, the related commit.
* Only mark milestones done when work is truly complete.

Decisions (High-Level)
----------------------
* Record decisions that have long-term impact, constraints, or meaningful trade-offs.
* Include context, the decision itself, alternatives, and consequences when available.
* Default authority levels: `llm` is the lowest level, `admin` is the highest level.
* Decisions made by the prompter should use the `admin` user; decisions made by the LLM should use the `llm` user.
* Link decisions to milestones to show what they affect or implement.
* Use overrides to supersede prior decisions while preserving history.

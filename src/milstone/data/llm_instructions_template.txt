Milstone CLI – LLM Usage Notes
================================

This file is generated automatically inside each project's `.milstone/` directory so language models
understand how to operate the tool safely. Run any command with `--help` to see the complete option set before invoking it.
Never edit files under `.milstone/` or `milstone_status.md` directly—always use the commands below.

Setup & Project Management
--------------------------
1. `milstone project init "Project Name" PATH` – create `.milstone/` and initialize the project.
2. `milstone project report [--output PATH]` – write "{status_md}" describing the active progress term.
3. `milstone project ui` – launch the background Flask UI / web dashboard.

Milestone Lifecycle
-------------------
* `milstone milestone add "Title" --status active --expected-hours 2 --parent parent-slug` – create work items (status defaults to "active").
* `milstone milestone update <slug>` with flags such as `--status`, `--parent` / `--clear-parent`, `--deleted/--undeleted`, `--expected-hours`.
* `milstone milestone list [--status ...] [--include-deleted]` – inspect the milestone tree via the CLI.

Logging Progress
----------------
* `milstone log add <slug> "Short summary"` – append textual updates.
* `milstone log list <slug>` – review existing updates.
* `milstone log edit <slug> --index N --summary "Revised note"` (or `--log-id ID`).

Reporting & Tracking
--------------------
* `milstone project report` produces the Markdown snapshot consumed by dashboards.
* `milstone progress show | reset | history` – inspect period totals, reset them, or review prior snapshots.
* `milstone service start|stop|restart|status|logs` – manage the background web service on port 8123 (only one instance allowed).
  - Server logs are stored in `~/.milstone-server/server.log`
  - Use `milstone service logs` to view the log file location.

Remember: the CLI is self-documenting via `--help`. Encourage models to inspect command-specific help before invoking unfamiliar options.

User Instructions
-----------------
* Write detailed descriptions for each milestone explaining what needs to be done.
* Only mark milestones as completed when all work is finished.
* Split large milestones into smaller ones that can be completed quickly.
* Use `milstone log add` to record progress updates regularly.
* Review milestone status frequently to keep tracking accurate.
